# Project Setup Instructions

## Docker Images
- Replace with our image.
- Ensure the Python version matches our project's requirements.

## Dependencies
- All dependencies should be listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Build Process
- We use `setuptools` which is configured via `setup.py`.

## Testing
- We are using `pytest` for testing.
  - If you're not using `pytest` or if your tests are in different directories, adjust the test jobs accordingly.

## Documentation
- We are using `Sphinx` for documentation.
  - If you're not using `Sphinx`, modify the `generate_docs` job to use your preferred documentation tool.

## Deployment
- The deployment jobs assume a `deploy.py` script.
  - Adjust these to match your actual deployment process.

## Artifact Paths
- Review all artifact paths to ensure they match your project's output structure.
